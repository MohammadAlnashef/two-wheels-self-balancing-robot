## Two Wheels Self Balance Robot  
Arduino act as PID controller    
his input is angle value from MPU6050 Sensor  
and output is the value of PWM that control the speed of motors.  

## Parts:  
- motors with wheels    
- MPU6050 : angle sensor (3-axis gyroscope and a 3-axis accelerometer)
- Arduino
- L293D : motors driver  
- motors with wheels  
- battery
